##### Time Lag Quasar Simulation

This repository contains a cleaned-up version of my freshman research project focused on optimized MCMC simulations using emcee and PyMC.  The goal of the project is to evaluate how increasing the sample size of Mg II and C IV time-delay quasars affects the precision of key cosmological parameters. The code is structured for performance, with plans to integrate Cython for accelerated sampling speeds.
